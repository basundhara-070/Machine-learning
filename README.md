# Basic differences between AI, ML, DL and Generative AI
1. AI - It is a broad field of creating machines that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence. E.g., Siri, chess playing programs.
2. ML - A subset of AI focused on algorithms that allow systems to learn from and improve based on data without explicit programming. E.g., Spam filtering, recommendation engines.
3. DL - A subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers. It mimics the human brain. E.g., Image recognition, speech recognition.
4. Generative AI - A branch of AI often powered by DL that generates new, creative outputs based on input data. E.g., ChatGPT, DALL.E. 

# Machine Learning
**1. Classificaton of ML**
   i. Supervised ML</br>
      - Regression</br>
      - Classification</br>
   ii. Unsupervised ML</br>
      - Clustering</br>
      - Dimensionality reduction</br>

**2. Supervised ML**
   Model learns from labeled data to make predictions or decisions.</br>
   _Types -_</br>
   - Regression - used for continuous output. E.g., predicting house prices, forcasting stock process.</br>
   - Classification - used for categorical output. E.g., email spam detection, image recognition.</br>
   
**3. Umsupervised ML**
   Model learns patterns, structures, or relationships in data without labeled outputs.</br>
  _Types-_</br>
  - Clustering - group data points into clusters based on similarity. E.g., customer segmentation in marketing, grouping similar documents or images.</br>
  - Dimensionality redution - reduces the number of features while preserving significant information. E.g., visualizing high-dimensional data, preprocessing for other ML tasks.</br>

**4. Algorithms in Supervised ML**
   - Linear Regression
   - Ridge and lasso
   - Logistic regression
   - Decision tree
   - AdaBoost
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting
   - Xgboost
   - Naive Baye's
   - SVM
   - KNN

**5. Algorithms in Unsupervised ML**
   - K Means
   - DB Scan
   - Hierarical
   - K nearest neighbour clusturing
   - PCA
   - LDA

# Linear Regression
Suppose we have a dataset in which we have some independent variable and a dependent variable. Using this dataset as training dataset we make a model and make
