# Basic differences between AI, ML, DL and Generative AI
1. AI - It is a broad field of creating machines that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence. E.g., Siri, chess playing programs.
2. ML - A subset of AI focused on algorithms that allow systems to learn from and improve based on data without explicit programming. E.g., Spam filtering, recommendation engines.
3. DL - A subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers. It mimics the human brain. E.g., Image recognition, speech recognition.
4. Generative AI - A branch of AI often powered by DL that generates new, creative outputs based on input data. E.g., ChatGPT, DALL.E.
