# Basic differences between AI, ML, DL and Generative AI
1. AI - It is a broad field of creating machines that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence. E.g., Siri, chess playing programs.
2. ML - A subset of AI focused on algorithms that allow systems to learn from and improve based on data without explicit programming. E.g., Spam filtering, recommendation engines.
3. DL - A subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers. It mimics the human brain. E.g., Image recognition, speech recognition.
4. Generative AI - A branch of AI often powered by DL that generates new, creative outputs based on input data. E.g., ChatGPT, DALL.E. 

# Machine Learning
**1. Classificaton of ML**
   i. Supervised ML
      - Regression
      - Classification
   ii. Unsupervised ML
      - Clustering
      - Dimensionality reduction

**2. Supervised ML**
   Model learns from labeled data to make predictions or decisions.
   _Types -_\n
   Regression - used for continuous output. E.g., predicting house prices, forcasting stock proces.\n
   Classification - used for categorical output. E.g., email spam detection, image recognition.
   
**3. Umsupervised ML**
   Model learns patterns, structures, or relationships in data without labeled outputs.
  _Types-_
  Clustering - group data points into clusters based on similarity. E.g., customer segmentation in marketing, grouping similar documents or images.
  - Dimensionality redution - reduces the number of features while preserving significant information. E.g., visualizing high-dimensional data, preprocessing for other ML tasks.
